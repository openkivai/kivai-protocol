# Kivai Protocol Roadmap

## Phase 1: Initial Setup
- Set up mock device handlers (mock-thermostat, mock-light, etc.)
- Implement basic unit tests for mock devices
- Ensure API responses and mock devices are functional

## Phase 2: Attracting Contributors
- Label issues with **good first issue** for easier onboarding
- Add documentation for project setup and usage
- Promote the project for visibility and attract initial contributors
- Provide a simple demo or CLI script to show how Kivai Protocol works

## Phase 3: Developer Experience
- Create SDKs for Kivai commands (Python/JS)
- Publish SDKs to PyPI/npm for easy access
- Add continuous integration (CI) via GitHub Actions to auto-check JSON schemas
- Expand the project's visibility by getting listed on developer-focused platforms (Awesome Lists, Reddit, Hacker News)

## Phase 4: Community Building
- Engage with contributors, maintainers, and developers
- Add more mock devices and use cases to expand the protocol
- Encourage collaboration on new features and improvements
- Establish a community-driven roadmap with ongoing feedback and contributions
